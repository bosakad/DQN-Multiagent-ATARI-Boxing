# DQN-Multiagent-ATARI-Boxing
Project that teaches 2 agents box each other.

Suggested extensions from the rainbow paper: 

* Double Q-learning
* Prioritized replay
* Multi-step learning - maybe
* Duelling networks - maybe
* Distributional RL - probably not - would be more parameters and change of network architecture
* Noisy Nets - maybe
